		<p style="font-size: 20px">Stroke is sometimes termed as brain attack or a cardiovascular accident (CVA). 
			It is much like a heart attack, only it occurs in the brain.<br>

		It occurs when the supply of blood to the brain is reduced or blocked completely, 
		which prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients.<br>

		According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause
		 of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
		Early identification of stroke can help doctors to give necessary medication to 
		the patient.</p>
